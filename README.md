# projectIfinityScroll
This project is created for practice purposes. This project presents a picture gallery where the user can scroll through various pictures fetched from an API (https://unsplash.com/). The user can also filter images by orientation.
Demo: https://project-infinity-scroll.web.app/


The idea of the project was to learn how to fetch data multiple times while scrolling. User can also choose what orientation of the pictures they want (landscape, portrait or squarish). To get pictures from API I used Fetch JS API. While user scrolls through pictures at a certain point, in the background fetch is getting new set of pictures which makes the scroll infinite. While pictures are loading, the user will see a spinner which makes user experience better.
